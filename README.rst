===================
Burgers Generalised
===================

Burgers equation is the simplified version of the Navier-Stokes equation (by dropping the pressure term). This equation can be investigated in one spatial dimension.
The generalised form of the Burgers equation is implemented in this example.


Building the example
====================

The fortran version of the example can be configured and built with CMake::

  git clone https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/burgers_generalised.git
  cd burgers_generalised
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DOpenCMISS_INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/opencmiss/install/  ../.
  make


Running the example
===================

Fortran version::

  cd src/fortran/
  ./burgers_generalised_fortran

The results can be visualised by running `visualiseBurgersGeneralised.cmgui <./src/fortran/visualiseBurgersGeneralised.cmgui>`_ with the `Cmgui visualiser <http://physiomeproject.org/software/opencmiss/cmgui/download>`_.
